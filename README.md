# Immerese_Oxford_Project
This is the final project of the Computer Science course at Immerse Education summer school at the **University of Oxford** (July 2022).

## Aim
The aim is to design a graphical user interface for identifying the registration year of a car based on their UK standard number plate.

## Tasks
1. Students are asked to design a graphical user interface application in which the user can either enter a carâ€™s number plate and the application calculate its registration year based on UK standards.  
2. The user can also upload an image of a car with its number plate visible and the application detects the number plate and calculates the registration year. The application should be able to connect to the Google Vision AI through API for text analysis in the image and also recognition of number plate area. 

## Conditions
- The application should be able to filter personalised or non-standard from standard UK number plates.
- It should be able to handle possible errors as much as possible.
- The GUI should be user-friendly.
- The user should be able to select if they want to process a text or an image.
